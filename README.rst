ODSC in a few words
===================

Is a meta tool to analyze the security Issues in third party libraries used in your project.

Why?
====

There're **many different tools for analyze third party vulnerabilities** for many languages, **but there're not a unique tool that works well for all of them**.

This implies that:

1. you need to locate the language specific tool,
2. learn how use it,
3. transform the results format to one you understand

We're created **this project to simplify this process** and you can focused only in the important: your project.

**ODSC** is a tool that **can choose the most suitable security tools for each languages and return unified and in friendly way**: a JSON format.
